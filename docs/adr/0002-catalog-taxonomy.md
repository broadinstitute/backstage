# 2. catalog-taxonomy

Date: 2024-01-27

## Status

Accepted

## Context
To avoid confusion and to make it easier to find the right catalog item, we need to have a clear taxonomy for the catalog items. The Backstage docs have a [taxonomy](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/descriptor-format) that we can use as a starting point.
## Decision

We will start by following the Backstage docs taxonomy and adapt it as we go along.

## Consequences

We will be able to find the right catalog item more easily, and associate it with the right category and team. We will also be able to use the taxonomy to create a better search experience.

* Risk: We might need to change the taxonomy as we go along.
* Risk: We might already have a conflicting taxonomy in place.
