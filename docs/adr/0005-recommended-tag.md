# 5. Tag external-facing templates with "Recommended" tag

Date: 2025-05-14

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want to have a simple filter that allows non-BITS users to find potentially
relevant resources. This would also allow us to have a single static link that
we can use to advertize these templates. We don't have any current standards on
how we tag templates right now.

## Decision

We are repurposing the existing "Recommended" tag to indicate that a template is
intended to be used (non-exclusively) by a non-BITS audience.

## Consequences

Using the existing tag allows us to keep the current page structure without
modification and stalls some tag bloat.
