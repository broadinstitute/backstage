# 4. Add Skills Exchange Plugin

Date: 2025-01-23

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our team has been working on providing a collaborative environment for other team members to share their knowledge, and learn from each other on Wednesdays.  We haven't seen as much participation as we would like, and have heard feedback that it's difficult to make time to join the sessions.  We want to make it easier for team members to share their knowledge and learn from each other.

We also want to promote a culture where we pick up hack projects, as well as make it easier for team members to find others who are interested in working on hack projects.

In our department we have a lot of people with different skills and knowledge, and we want to make it easier for team members to find others who have the skills they need to complete their projects.

## Decision

We will trial run the [Spotify Skills Exchange](https://backstage.spotify.com/docs/plugins/skill-exchange/) plugin. Our trail period will be for 3 months.

## Consequences

We will need to install the Skills Exchange plugin and configure it to work with our existing Backstage instance.
We will socialize this new feature to the team and encourage them to use it.
Both of this will require some time and effort from the team, but we believe it will be worth it in the long run.

In addition we will, potentially, need to purchase a license in order to use it beyond the trial period, as well as uninstall the plugin if we decide not to purchase a license.

We will need to monitor the usage of the plugin and gather feedback from the team to see if it is helping to increase participation in the knowledge sharing sessions and hack projects.
    * We can gather feedback by sending out a survey to the team, or by monitoring the usage of the plugin.
